# Product Opportunities

Improvement ideas discovered through real usage. Each entry captures the problem, a concrete example, and a proposed direction.

See [VISION.md](./VISION.md) for product vision, [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical decisions.

**Strategic sequencing:** Send (draft + SMTP) is in the vision. Send is blocked on customer validation for core search/index/onboarding — we want to nail that first. See [OPP-011](opportunities/OPP-011-send-email.md).

## Active opportunities

| ID | Title | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [OPP-001](opportunities/OPP-001-personalization.md) | Personalization — User Context for Search | Let users define aliases and context so queries like "ranch" match emails that use project names like "Son Story." |
| [OPP-002](opportunities/OPP-002-local-embeddings.md) | Local Embeddings — Eliminate Search Latency and OpenAI Dependency | Replace OpenAI API embeddings with a local `bge-small-en-v1.5` model via transformers.js. Cuts search latency, removes the `OPENAI_API_KEY` requirement. |
| [OPP-006](opportunities/OPP-006-attachment-search-and-caching.md) | Attachment Search and Sibling-File Caching | FTS5 indexing of attachment content so search matches inside PDFs/docs; sibling-file caching for faster reads; additional format support (PPTX, images via vision). Extraction is shipped — these are next steps. |
| [OPP-010](opportunities/OPP-010-sync-performance.md) | Sync / Refresh Performance — 5x Faster | Achieved 5x faster "nothing new" refreshes (42s → 8.2s) via STATUS fast path, EXAMINE instead of SELECT, parallel connect, and batch optimizations. See [SYNC.md](./SYNC.md) for implementation details. |
| [OPP-011](opportunities/OPP-011-send-email.md) | Send Email — Draft + SMTP | Add send via SMTP (send-as-user). Draft + confirm, voice profile from history, tagline. **Blocked on customer validation for core search/index/onboarding.** |
| [OPP-012](opportunities/OPP-012-who-smart-address-book.md) | Make `zmail who` a Smart, Unified Address Book | Evolve `zmail who` into identity-aware contact graph: case-insensitive dedup, identity merging, signature extraction (phone/title/company), relationship scoring, noreply filtering. |
