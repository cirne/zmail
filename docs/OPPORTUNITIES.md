## Active opportunities

| ID | Title | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [OPP-001](opportunities/OPP-001-personalization.md) | Personalization — User Context for Search | Let users define aliases and context so queries like "ranch" match emails that use project names like "Son Story." |
| [OPP-002](opportunities/OPP-002-local-embeddings.md) | Local Embeddings — Eliminate Search Latency and OpenAI Dependency | Replace OpenAI API embeddings with a local `bge-small-en-v1.5` model via transformers.js. Cuts search latency, removes the `OPENAI_API_KEY` requirement. |
| [OPP-006](opportunities/OPP-006-attachment-search-and-caching.md) | Attachment Search and Sibling-File Caching | FTS5 indexing of attachment content so search matches inside PDFs/docs; sibling-file caching for faster reads; additional format support (PPTX, images via vision). Extraction is shipped — these are next steps. |
