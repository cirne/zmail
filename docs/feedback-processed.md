# Processed Feedback

This file tracks feedback files from `../ztest/feedback/` that have been processed. A feedback item is considered "processed" when we have decided what to do with it and completed that action (ignore, create bug, create opportunity, update docs, etc.).

**Format:** Each entry includes:
- Feedback filename
- Date processed
- Action taken (bug created, opportunity created, ignored, etc.)
- Related bug/opportunity ID (if applicable)
