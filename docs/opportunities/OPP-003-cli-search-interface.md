# OPP-003: CLI Search Interface — Header-First Results + Selective Hydration

**Problem:** The current CLI search interface is optimized for "return rich snippets now" rather than "help an agent iterate quickly." In real agent workflows, this causes unnecessary latency, oversized payloads, and brittle post-processing.

Observed pain points:

- **Single fixed result shape:** Search always returns message metadata plus snippet, with no projection or detail controls.
- **Always-hybrid execution:** Search always runs FTS + semantic, even when a fast metadata/keyword pass is sufficient.
- **Large output fragility:** Broad searches with high limits can exceed output boundaries and return malformed JSON.
- **No first-class shortlist → hydrate flow:** The workflow exists conceptually (`search` then `message`/`thread`), but search output is not tuned for fast shortlist creation.

**Example (real cloud run):**

- Hybrid query latency (`zmail search "opening eye in bedding calls" --json`) was ~588ms p50.
- Filter-only query latency (`zmail search --from hello@theinformation.com --json`) was ~233ms p50.
- A broad search (`receipt`, `--limit 200`) produced truncated output and invalid JSON at 65,536 bytes.

This gap shows that many agent tasks are paying hybrid + payload costs when they only need headers first.

## Proposed direction

Make the CLI explicitly support a two-step agent retrieval pattern:

1. **Find candidates fast** (header-first, smaller payload, lower latency)
2. **Hydrate selected messages** only when needed

### 1) Header-first defaults

Add search detail controls:

- `--detail headers|snippet|body`
- Default to `headers`

Default `headers` payload should include only:

- `messageId`, `threadId`, `date`, `fromAddress`, `fromName`, `subject`, `rank` (and optional tiny `preview`)

### 2) Query mode controls

Add:

- `--mode auto|fts|semantic|hybrid`

`auto` should choose fast path when query/filter intent is clearly lexical or metadata-driven (sender/date/ID), and choose hybrid when semantic retrieval is likely beneficial.

### 3) Field projection + payload safety

Add:

- `--fields` for explicit projection (`messageId,threadId,date,fromAddress,subject`)
- `--cursor` pagination (in addition to offset)
- output byte cap and explicit `truncated` indicator when limits are hit
- stricter `--limit` bounds for JSON mode

### 4) First-class hydration ergonomics

Keep `zmail message <id>` and `zmail thread <id>` as follow-up calls, but align search output to make this easy:

- always include stable IDs
- optionally include `--ids-only` for ultra-cheap shortlist generation

### 5) Built-in timings for tuning

Add:

- `--timings` to print machine-readable stage timings (fts_ms, embed_ms, vector_ms, merge_ms, total_ms, mode_used)

This helps agent planners choose faster modes dynamically.

## Implementation plan

1. Extend `SearchOptions` and CLI argument parser with `detail`, `mode`, `fields`, `cursor`, `timings`.
2. Refactor `search()` to support mode selection instead of always-hybrid execution.
3. Add output shaping layer (headers/snippet/body + field projection) before serialization.
4. Add byte-safe serializer with truncation metadata.
5. Add cursor pagination contract for stable iteration.
6. Document recommended agent pattern:
   - `search --detail headers --fields ... --limit N`
   - then `message` / `thread` on selected IDs only.

## What stays the same

- SQLite FTS5 + LanceDB hybrid architecture
- Existing `search`, `message`, and `thread` command surfaces
- RRF ranking logic for hybrid mode

## Open questions

- Should default `--mode` be `auto` or remain `hybrid` for backward relevance expectations?
- Should `--detail body` return full `body_text` or a bounded excerpt by default?
- Should payload caps be fixed or user-configurable (`--max-bytes`)?
- Should we add a task-oriented command (`zmail purchases --after 30d`) now, or wait until the core search interface changes are in place?
